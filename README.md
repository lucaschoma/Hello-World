# SuperMarket
My first repository

I am an enthuastic programmer. I love coding and have passion for developing apps. I am still familiarizing myself with the Github resources though.

This is my first data analytics project:

â€¢	Data analytics tool that can help grocery buyers to check and compare prices to see which supermarket have been offering better promotional sales and combos for their needs.
